- 👋 Hi, I’m Owen Graham!
- 👀 I’m interested in amateur radio, music, computers...anything that has to do with electronics!!!
- 🌱 I’m currently earning my Masters of Science in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University
- 🎮 I am also interested in 8-bit gaming/computer systems! I plan to one day construct a basic 6502-based computer with only the MOS 6502 and a capable microcontroller like the Raspberry Pi Pico.
- 👀 Thank you for stopping by my GitHub page! Don't be afraid to leave comments, issues, or anything that you feel would help me develop my coding skills!
